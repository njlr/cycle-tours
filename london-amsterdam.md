#### Notes

 - Not the greatest cycling; ignore the cycle paths since they are too short anyway.
 - You will need to cycle on the road, but there isn't much traffic and drivers overtake carefully.
 - Really good restaurant called [La Cambuse](http://www.la-cambuse.com/) in Dunkirk
 - We stayed at [Hotel B&B](https://http:/www.hotel-bb.com/en/hotels/dunkerque-centre-gare.htm) by the station, (£50 per night) and they let us take bikes into the room.

### Day 2 (Dunkirk - Bruges 80km)


 - From the centre of Dunkirk, follow signs to Plage de Malo les Bains and cycle along the promenade by the beaches.
 - At Leffrinckouche turn away from the coast and join the Route de Furnes (D601) beside the canal.
 - In Belgium the road becomes the N39. Cycle along the canal following the LF1B to Veurne, Nieuwpoort, Oudenburg and finally into Bruges.

#### Notes

* We stopped for coffee in Veurne (very beautiful and historic) and lunch in Nieuwpoort.
* Leaving Veurne there is a cycle path with WW2 ruins, which is a nice detour. There is a map outside the cathedral. 
* In Bruges we stayed at [Hotel t'Putje](https://thehotelputje.com/en/home/) (£70 per night). They had a shed where we locked our bikes.
* We had dinner at [Gran Kaffee de Passage.](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/belgium/bruges/restaurants/gran-kaffee-de-passage/a/poi-eat/428011/358711)
* Bruges is lovely and you can easily walk around the centre. There are lots of great bars and cafes.
* We bought breakfast from the small Carrefour near the hotel which opened at 8am.




### Day 3 (Bruges - Delft 170km)

 - This is the biggest day and goes across several bridges and ferries, so make sure you leave early. The entire day took us 11 hours including breaks. 
 - There is a cycle path that goes most of the way called the LF1B, so try to stick to that. 
 - Don't worry about the bridges; they all have a dedicated cycle lane.

 - Cycle from Bruges to Breskens via Damme and Sluis.
 - Take the bike ferry from Breskens to Vlissingen (leaves every 15mins, takes 20mins, 4,20€ per person and you can pay by card)
 - Cycle from Vlissingen to Rozenburg along the LF1B, crossing several bridges.
 - Take the ferry from Rozenburg to Maassluis (goes every 20 mins, costs 1,80€ per person with bike, you need cash and pay on the ferry). The ferry stops running at around 11pm. 
 - Cycle from Maassluis to Delft.

### Day 5 (Rest)

### Day 6 (Amsterdam - Hook of Holland)

 - You can either cycle this or get the train. The tickets cost 13,30€ each and you also need to buy a 'dagkaart fiets' (bike ticket) which costs 6,10€. Buy the tickets from a machine at the station. Amsterdam - Schiedam takes about 53 minutes.
 - When we went, there was no train connection from Schiedam to Hook of Holland, but it is a short cycle (25km) on well signposted cycle-paths.
 - Don't miss the ferry! There is only one every 24 hours. We booked with [Stena line](https://www.stenaline.co.uk/ferry-to-holland) and an overnight cabin cost £137 for 2 people and bikes. It was surprisingly comfortable and there was even a cinema on board.

### Day 7 (Harwich - London)

 - We got the train from Harwich to London Liverpool Street. No need to book in advance. 
 - Train guard was a real dick, but whatchagonnado. 

### Other useful information

![](https://i.imgur.com/Q5AC99q.jpg)


* The LF1B is very well signposted - however at times you will see signs for your destination pointing in different directions. Red is the direct route and green is the scenic route! They will finish in the same place. 
* Don't worry about getting lost - at times we wandered off the cycle path and always managed to pick it up again!
* The route is VERY flat!
* Hotels each charge a few euros in city tax when you check in.
* I booked all of the hotels in advance through the Trip Advisor website.
